# Voronoi Art gen

## What We're Making

We're creating a computer program that makes art inspired by a special pattern found in nature. This pattern divides space into regions based on special points, creating a beautiful network of shapes.

## How It Works

1. **Placing the Points**: 
   We start by telling the computer to place several special points on the screen.

2. **Drawing the Regions**: 
   The computer then draws lines that divide the space around these points into unique regions.

3. **Making It Move**: 
   We make the points move around slowly, which causes the regions to change and shift.

4. **Coloring the Picture**: 
   We color each line based on where it is, creating a shifting, shimmering effect.

## Fun Things You Can Do

- **Number of Points**: Add more or fewer points to make the pattern more complex or simple.
- **Movement Speed**: Make the points move faster or slower, changing how quickly the pattern shifts.

## Why This is Cool

This project shows a pattern that appears in many places in nature, from the cells in a leaf to the spots on a giraffe. It's a way of seeing how nature organizes space!

## Try It Yourself!

- Get the code and set it up just like with the other simulations.
- Run the program:

```python
python gen-art/voronoi/voronoi_art.py
```

When you play with this, you're exploring a fundamental way that nature creates patterns.
