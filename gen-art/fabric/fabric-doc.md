# Fabric gen

## What We're Making

We're creating a computer program that draws lots of lines. These lines will move and wiggle like threads in a piece of cloth blowing in the wind.

## How It Works

1. **Drawing the Lines**: 
   First, we tell the computer to draw many straight lines.

2. **Adding the Magic Wiggles**: 
   We use something called "Perlin noise" - a special recipe for random wiggles that look natural and smooth.

3. **Making it Move**: 
   We tell the computer to keep redrawing the lines, each time with slightly different wiggles. This makes it look like the fabric is moving!

4. **Coloring and Styling**: 
   We can change how thick the lines are, how many there are, and how big the waves are.

## Fun Things You Can Do

- **Number of threads**: Add more or fewer threads to the fabric.
- **Thread Thickness**: Make the threads thicker or thinner.
- **Thread Spacing**: Make the threads closer together or farther apart.
- **Wave Size**: Make big, gentle waves or small, ripply ones.
- **Movement**: Make the fabric move fast or slow.
- **Fabric Texture**: Make the fabric smoother or more textured.
- **Overall Scale**: Make the fabric bigger or smaller.

## Why This is Cool

This project shows how we can use math and computers to make beautiful, moving art.

## Try It Yourself!

- Get the code on the system 
```
git clone https://github.com/swap357/pyx
cd pyx
```

- Install the dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run the program
```python
python gen-art/fabric/fabric.py
```

Remember, every time you change something, you're being an artist and a scientist at the same time. How cool is that?
