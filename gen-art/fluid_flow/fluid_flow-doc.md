# Fluid Flow gen

## What We're Making

We're creating a computer program that simulates tiny particles flowing like a liquid. These particles move and swirl, creating beautiful patterns that look like flowing water or swirling smoke.

## How It Works

1. **Creating Particles**: 
   We start by telling the computer to create lots of tiny dots.

2. **Making Them Flow**: 
   We use special math to make each dot move in a way that looks like it's part of a flowing liquid.

3. **Keeping It Moving**: 
   The computer keeps updating where each dot should be, making it look like the fluid is constantly flowing.

4. **Painting the Picture**: 
   We can change how many dots there are, how fast they move, and how big they look.

## Fun Things You Can Do

- **Number of Particles**: Add more or fewer dots to make the fluid look thicker or thinner.
- **Flow Scale**: Change how big the swirls and currents in the fluid are.
- **Particle Speed**: Make the fluid flow faster or slower.
- **Particle Size**: Make each dot bigger or smaller.

## Why This is Cool

This project shows how simple rules for each tiny part can create complex, beautiful patterns for the whole. It's a bit like how real fluids work in nature!

## Try It Yourself!

- Get the code and set it up just like with the fabric simulation.
- Run the program:

```python
python gen-art/fluid_flow/fluid_flow.py
```

Every time you adjust a setting, you're exploring how small changes can create big effects in nature.
